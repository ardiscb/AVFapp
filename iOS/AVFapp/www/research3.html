		<!-- Question 1 -->
		<p><strong>What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.? Japan? Great Britain?</strong></p>
		<!-- Answer 1 -->
		<p>The top selling categories in the U.S. is Games (Garun, 2012). Japan and Great Britain both download games the most as well (&quot;Revealed, the&quot;).</p>
		<!-- Question 2 -->
		<p><strong>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</strong></p>
		<!-- Answer 2 -->
		<p>Each market is trying to appeal to younger people and/or people who like to play games, at least at this moment.</p>
		<!-- Question 3 -->
		<p><strong>What are the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</strong></p>
		<!-- Answer 3 -->
		<p>Japan costs $0.27 per mbps with a bandwidth limit of 61 mbps. United States cost $3.00 per mbps with a bandwidth limit of 4.8 mbps. Great Britain cost approximately $10.00 per mbps with a bandwidth limit of 1.0 mbps. (&quot;Internet costs and,&quot; 2011)
		</p>
		<p>The more limits are decreased, the harder developers will have to work to make their apps require the least amount of upload and download usage.
		</p>
		<!-- Question 4 -->
		<p><strong>And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</strong></p>
		<!-- Answer 4 -->
		<p>At this point in time, while all three markets are best selling games, I would want to develop a game or an app that could accompany a game. I would market it to Japan, U.S., and Great Britain. </p>
		<p>Also, I will keep up with industry trends in these markets and others so I can produce an app that the users are looking for at any particular time.
