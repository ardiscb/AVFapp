	<div class="main" class="research">
		<!-- Question 1 -->
		<p><strong>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</strong></p>
		<!-- Answer 1 -->
		<p>Instead of using a section tag within a div, I could change it to just use the section tag. Also, to make it easier to tell that there are a list of links, I could put my a tags within li tags in an ordered or unordered list tag.</p>
		<!-- Question 2 -->
		<p><strong>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</strong></p>
		<!-- Answer 2 -->
		<p>Screen Readers do not always read content in the way that it’s visually represented. I watched a video on YouTube about how searching for a video on YouTube is nearly impossible for the deaf or blind because the screen readers, such a Jaws or Voice Over, do not clearly state where the search bar is, how to turn up the volume, etc. They also talk over the video so this simple task becomes very frustrating.</p>
		<!-- Question 3 -->
		<p><strong>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</strong></p>
		<!-- Answer 3 -->
		<p>All Mac OS and iOS devices since Mac OS 10.4 have Voice Over built in, which is specifically made for accessibility. Voice Over offers a way to browse webpages as they really are and it also allows for a user to set a sweet spot for certain spots on a webpage that is visited most often. The sweet spot will always be the first thing the Voice Over reads to make it easier and faster to get the information most wanted.
		</p>
		<p>Talking calculators were invented in the late 70s. It speaks the button’s functions and some can be used with or without a screen reader.
		</p>
		<!-- Question 4 -->
		<p><strong>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</strong></p>
		<!-- Answer 4 -->
		<p>The LookTel Money Reader app is made for the visually impaired to be able to identify US currency by using the camera to take a picture of the bill. It can be found in the Apple App Store for $1.99. </p>
		<p>The Color Identifier app allows a user to take a picture of an object and then speaks the colors of the object. The colors can be read as basic colors or shades of colors, such as Forest Green, Plum, etc. It can be found in the Apple App Store for $1.99.
